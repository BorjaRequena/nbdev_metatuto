# Nbdev tutorial of the tutorial
> Supertutorial of the tutorial for nbdev :D


This is mainly a guide for me to follow during my live tutorial and, at the same time, get familiar with nbdev while writing it. 

## Install

`pip install nbdev_metatuto`

## How to use

We can't really screw anything up. There is only one function and one class so far:

```python
say_hi("Bitz")
```




    'Hii Bitz!'



```python
ss = SoothSayer("Emilio")
ss.say()
```




    'Hii Emilio!'
